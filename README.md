# Product-Count-Violation

# ML Model detection data:
●	Pins and core detection ( presented in the moulding machine from Loading to shifting).
●	Draw Region (Identifies Loading region and shifting  or transport region).
●	Product counting violation detection (between time of entering and to shifting from transport region). 
  Core Violation: The actual no.of the cores  aren’t presented in the mold. 

## Annotation:
  Images extracted from the video then annotate by using the Labelimg tool
  
## Custom Object Detection:
  yolov3-tiny model is used to detect the objects
